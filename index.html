        <h4 class="explanation">When we plant a tree, it's like lending the planet one green superhero! The trees are the all-natural multitaskers of our world, converting carbon dioxide into life-giving oxygen every time that we inhale and exhale. They are also natural air conditioners bringing down the overall temperature and providing cool shades. They have deep roots that hold the soil together to prevent erosion and also maintain water flowing, decreasing flooding. Which brings us to this: they also make homes and habitats for wildlife! When you plant that tree, it means much more than just another leafy green is popping into existence — it's one less toxin in the air and an investment toward a cleaner world for future generations.</h4>

        <hr>
        <h4 class="explanation">Cleaning up the environment is like offering a fresh makeover to our planet, and keeping it alive for all. All this includes cleaning up litter from areas of natural beauty such as parks, beaches, and rivers; tackling pollution of water environments through microplastics waste food chains & poisoning or entanglement marine life with plastics. These are the small things you can do to protect wildlife, air and water quality as well as our natural surroundings by simply participating in clean-ups. But the beauty of this is that it brings people together for a common cause — to give back and work on preserving our planet (not just destroying) for future generations!</h4>

        <hr>
        <h4 class="explanation">Experience the awesomeness of “Repurpose, Reuse & Recycle” — a triad seemingly derived from wizardry to turn trash into treasure! Reduce means using less of the things we use or preventing waste before it begins. Reuse means that certain things can be used for other uses, and generate less need to obtain new resources. The last charm is Recycle, or how to give life back to waste by making it a new product and saving sources for not taking out of the nature. Combined, these efforts form a virtuous circle of sustainability that transforms routine tasks into meaningful contributions to benefit Earth.</h4>
